#AI MAVERICKS

Structure and Purpose of the AI-Powered Medical Booth

Structure:

This repository is structured as follows:
- `backend/`: This directory contains the backend code of the Bottles4Health platform, including the database models (Mongo Database) and Python.
- `frontend/`: Here, you will find the frontend code for the Plastic4Health platform, implemented using JavaScript, React, CSS and HTML. 
- `models/`: This directory contains the Generative AI model (ChatGPT) used by Plastic4Health to enhance the platform's capabilities. 
1.	Portable Design:
   
o	Description: The medical booth is designed to be easily transportable and can be set up in various locations, including remote and underserved areas.

o	Components: 

	Solar Panels: Ensure a steady power supply, especially in areas with unstable energy sources. This renewable energy source supports the booth's functionality, even in regions with unstable power grids, thereby enhancing reliability and sustainability.

	Multilingual Interface: Accommodates a wide range of demographics, making it accessible to more people.

	Camera and Microphone: Enable live video consultations with doctors for immediate medical attention.

4.	Payment System:
   
o	Description: An innovative payment method using plastic bottles to promote environmental sustainability.

o	Mechanism: Users can deposit plastic bottles into the booth, which are then recycled, providing a cost-effective way to access healthcare services.

Purpose:

•	Healthcare Accessibility: Provide convenient, on-the-spot healthcare services to people in rural and underserved areas, reducing the need for long-distance travel to healthcare facilities.

•	Environmental Sustainability: Address the issue of plastic pollution by encouraging the recycling of plastic bottles as a form of payment.

•	Economic Affordability: Offer an affordable healthcare solution for those living below the international poverty threshold, making essential medical services accessible to all.

How the AI-Powered Medical Booth Solves the Problem:

1.	Improving Healthcare Access:
   
o	Challenge: Many Namibians, especially in rural areas, face significant barriers to accessing healthcare, leading to untreated illnesses and poor health outcomes.

o	Solution: The medical booth provides immediate access to healthcare services, reducing travel distances and wait times. Live video consultations with doctors ensure that even severe symptoms can be addressed promptly.

3.	Promoting Environmental Sustainability:
   
o	Challenge: Namibia generates approximately 70,000 tons of plastic waste annually, with only 5% being recycled.

o	Solution: By using plastic bottles as a form of payment, the booth encourages recycling and helps reduce plastic pollution. This innovative approach not only provides healthcare access but also addresses a major environmental issue.

5.	Ensuring Economic Affordability:
   
o	Challenge: An estimated 18% of Namibians live below the international poverty threshold of $1.90 per day, making healthcare unaffordable for many.

o	Solution: The booth’s payment system using plastic bottles offers a more economical way for people to access healthcare services, ensuring that financial constraints do not prevent them from receiving necessary medical care.

By integrating AI technology, renewable energy, and an innovative payment system, the AI-powered medical booth aims to revolutionize healthcare access in Namibia, addressing both medical and environmental challenges in a sustainable and impactful way.
